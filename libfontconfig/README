			Fontconfig
	Font configuration and customization library
		      Version 2.2
		        2003-3-1

This is the third public release of fontconfig, a font configuration and
customization library.  Fontconfig is designed to locate fonts within the
system and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific library
'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts.
